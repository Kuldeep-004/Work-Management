/**
 * GROUP CHAT PROFILE PICTURES ENHANCEMENT
 * =======================================
 * 
 * FEATURE: Always Show Profile Pictures in Group Chats
 * 
 * CHANGES MADE:
 * 
 * 1. ChatView.jsx:
 *    - Updated showAvatar logic to always be true for group chats
 *    - Removed condition that only showed avatars for first message or different sender
 *    - Now: showAvatar={chat?.type === 'group'} // Always show avatar in group chats
 * 
 * 2. MessageBubble.jsx:
 *    - Split avatar logic into two separate conditions:
 *      * Group chats: Always show avatars for non-own messages
 *      * Private chats: Use showAvatar prop for conditional display
 *    - Always show sender names in group chats (removed showAvatar dependency)
 *    - Updated spacer logic to only apply to private chats
 * 
 * 3. Enhanced Visual Features:
 *    - Added getUserColor() function for consistent avatar colors
 *    - Added getUserTextColor() function for matching name colors
 *    - 10 different color combinations for better user distinction
 *    - Colors are generated based on user ID hash for consistency
 * 
 * RESULT:
 * - Every message in group chats now shows the sender's profile picture
 * - Each user has a consistent, unique color for their avatar and name
 * - Better visual distinction between different users
 * - WhatsApp-like experience with continuous profile pictures
 * - Private chats maintain original behavior
 * 
 * USER EXPERIENCE:
 * - Easier to identify who sent each message at a glance
 * - Consistent color coding helps users recognize frequent participants
 * - More engaging and visually appealing group conversations
 * - Profile pictures provide quick visual context for each message
 * 
 * COLORS USED:
 * - Blue, Purple, Pink, Red, Orange, Yellow, Teal, Indigo, Cyan, Emerald
 * - Each user gets assigned one color consistently across all their messages
 * - Colors are generated using a hash function for deterministic assignment
