## Testing
- Backend server: `http://localhost:5000` 
- Frontend server: `http://localhost:5174`
- Both features are ready for testing in the browser

## Permissions
- Client Group Edit: Admin, Team Head, Senior roles only

## API Endpoints Used
- `PUT /api/clients/groups/:id` - Edit client group (NEW)
