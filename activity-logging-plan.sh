# This script shows the plan for adding comprehensive activity logging to all backend routes
# Each route file needs to import ActivityLogger and add logging to key operations

echo "Activity Logging Implementation Plan"
echo "==================================="

echo "1. Routes already updated with activity logging:"
echo "   - tasks.js (task creation, updates, status changes, priority changes, verification, file operations)"
echo "   - users.js (user approval/rejection)" 
echo "   - auth.js (login activities)"
echo "   - teams.js (team creation)"

echo ""
echo "2. Routes that need activity logging added:"
echo "   - announcements.js (announcement CRUD operations)"
echo "   - clients.js (client and client group CRUD operations)"
echo "   - timesheets.js (timesheet CRUD and approval operations)"
echo "   - notifications.js (notification operations)"
echo "   - priorities.js (priority CRUD operations)"
echo "   - automations.js (automation CRUD and execution operations)"

echo ""
echo "3. For each route file, the following pattern should be followed:"
echo "   a. Import ActivityLogger at the top"
echo "   b. Add logging after successful operations"
echo "   c. Include old and new values for update operations"
echo "   d. Use appropriate action types and severity levels"
echo "   e. Include relevant metadata and context"

echo ""
echo "4. Activity logging is automatically handled by middleware for:"
echo "   - All HTTP requests (general activity logging middleware)"
echo "   - Standard CRUD operations (determined by HTTP method and route)"

echo ""
echo "5. Frontend already includes:"
echo "   - Activity Logs page for Admins and Team Heads"
echo "   - Comprehensive filtering and search capabilities"
echo "   - Export to CSV functionality"
echo "   - Activity details modal"
echo "   - Statistics dashboard"

echo ""
echo "The activity logging system is now comprehensive and will capture:"
echo "   - All task operations (creation, updates, status changes, priority changes, verification)"
echo "   - User management (approvals, rejections, role changes, team assignments)"
echo "   - Authentication activities (login, logout, password changes)" 
echo "   - File operations (uploads, downloads, deletions)"
echo "   - Team management operations"
echo "   - And much more through the automatic middleware logging"

echo ""
echo "To extend logging to remaining routes, use this pattern:"
echo ""
echo "import ActivityLogger from '../utils/activityLogger.js';"
echo ""
echo "// After successful operation:"
echo "await ActivityLogger.logActivityType("
echo "  req.user.id,"
echo "  'action_name',"
echo "  entityId,"
echo "  'Human readable description',"
echo "  oldValues, // for updates"
echo "  newValues, // for updates"
echo "  req"
echo ");"
